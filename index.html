            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>After having toured around the world from the US to Japan, Bobby Sant disappeared almost 
                    completely off the radar. He made some rare appearances, isolated himself and let new songs
                    come back to him.
                </p>
                <p>Bobby expresses his music with sensitive sincerity. That's why his music hits you both in 
                    the head and the heart. His lyrics about being broken, hopeful and totally hopeless stay in the 
                    brightest spotlight. Bobby Sant's songwriting is constantly searching for those timeless melodies.
                    It has been his trademark ever since his debut album <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3SAaIw77RP0IZqGrIQUH0O" target="_blank" class="link">"It's Just A Lonely Feeling" </a> in 2012 (with cover 
                    art from Townes Van Zandt's daughter Katie).
